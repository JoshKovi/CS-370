# CS-370
AI development Project with Keras and Q-Learning environment




Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project the work in the Qtrain method was the only code created by myself. The rest of the code outisde of this
function was provided by SNHU. This code is the primary Q-learning strategy implemented, though at this point their have been dozens
of different approaches taken and this is just the iteration that the code is currently on. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    Computer scientist discover and invent new ways to use computer in ways beneficial to humanity. In the field of AI and ML
this can result in machines learning to solve problems reducing or eliminating human error and the need to dedicate human
resources towards solving a problem. Computer scientists often come up with new and exciting ways to solve problems and
improve efficiency, which in the long term can be built upon and lead to even greater efficiency gains and more problems 
being solved. If the problems that are solved can impact humanity (IE: finding a new cancer treatment drug) these advancements
can matter alot.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    Personally, I like to approach a problem with the dumbest possible solution in mind. While that solution is by no means
the most efficient for the problem, it allows me to work-out the solution rather efficiently. From there, optimization of an
already discovered solution is relatively easy in comparison. This allows me to efficiently solve a problem (occassionally with
brute force, like nested for loops) and then optimize that solution without having to increase the complexity of the solution until
the problem and solution are well understood. Understanding the problem is the first step to solving it and by not worrying about
other issuues like time efficiency or complex data structuure simultaneously you can focus on the issue at hand with no offshoots or 
distractions. Often I find that I can write some amount of code to solve a problem in a couple minutes, and right as I complete the 
last line of the solution I already understand how to optimize and streamline the code in a way that had not occured to me before I 
had the solution in hand. While I may lose the couple minutes I took to write the initial code, I gain all the time I would be taking
coming up with and testing a more optimized solution. 


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    Ethically my responsibilities to both the end user and organization are similar, and that is not to be evil. In more words,
I have a responsibility to understand the implications of whatever I am designing and/or building, and voicing concerns within the organization
if they develop. Similarly, to the end user I have some level of ethical constraint against taking advantage of their ignorance or misleading
them. If either of these ethical responsibilities are not met, I have a moral responsibility to leave at the very least.
